= AmbientOps Hospital Model

AmbientOps presents system tooling as a hospital to help everyday users navigate complex situations calmly and safely.

== Why a hospital?

Most “system tools” fail users in two ways:

* They feel scary and technical, so users freeze or panic.
* They use fearware tactics (fake urgency, inflated counts, vague “errors”).

A hospital metaphor communicates:

* There are different levels of response (observe → triage → procedure).
* Safety, consent, and records are normal.
* You don’t need to be an expert to get help.

== Departments

=== Ward (daily home)

*Purpose:* ambient oversight and gentle guidance.

* “System Weather” status (e.g., Calm/Watch/Act)
* Small role-based helpers (HAT roles) appear when something matters
* Always offers one safe next step
* Includes profiles (child/general/dev/tech) and a notification budget

Ward should reduce unnecessary Emergency Room usage by catching issues early and explaining them calmly.

=== Emergency Room (panic-safe intake)

*Purpose:* stabilize, capture evidence, enable safety posture, and hand off.

Emergency Room is for:

* suspected compromise
* imminent data loss
* “I don’t know what’s happening and I’m scared”

Emergency Room must be:

* non-destructive by default
* offline-first by default
* fully logged into an incident bundle
* able to hand off to:
  - Personal Sysadmin crisis workflows
  - Operating Room scan/plan

=== Operating Room (planned procedures)

*Purpose:* planned, consent-based changes with undo and receipts.

Operating Room is the only place where the system performs “doer” actions.

Operating Room flow:

1. Scan (non-mutating)
2. Plan (previewed, reversible steps labelled)
3. Apply (explicit approval required)
4. Undo (where possible)
5. Receipt (always)

Technician-level operations live here and are expert-gated.

=== Records

*Purpose:* trust and continuity.

Records contain:

* receipts (human-readable + machine-readable)
* undo tokens / rollback guidance
* incident bundles for sharing with helpers
* “referral letters” via feedback-a-tron (with redaction presets)

== Roles (HAT model)

Ward uses “roles” (themeable as staff, hats, hamsters, etc.). The default mapping:

* Coordinator (Blue) — “what’s happening overall?” / “one next step”
* Information (White) — facts, measurements, evidence pointers
* Risk/Caution (Black) — guardrails, safety concerns, escalation triggers
* Optimisation/Positive (Green/Yellow) — improvements, diagnostics, reassurance
* (Optional) Comfort (Red) — reassurance language, anxiety reduction

Roles are UI/UX only; they do not add capabilities beyond the underlying tools.

== Profiles

Profiles control:

* intrusiveness (Quiet/Balanced/Proactive)
* detail level (Minimal/Standard/Detailed)
* which roles can interrupt
* which actions are visible (especially expert-gated actions)

Example intent:

* Child: proactive risk + minimal detail + limited controls
* General: balanced + clear language + safe handoffs
* Developer: high detail info flows, risk nudges toned down
* Technician: full detail + expert packs visible, still plan-first

== Safety boundaries (non-negotiables)

* Ward never applies changes.
* Emergency Room defaults to non-destructive actions.
* Operating Room requires explicit approval to apply.
* Every apply produces a receipt.
* Undo is first-class (and “not reversible” must be clearly labelled).
* No fearware copy; evidence beats theatrics.

== Deep-links and artifacts (seams)

Ward and ER should navigate into OR and Records using stable intents.

Shared artifacts:

* System Weather payload (Ward input)
* Evidence envelope (Scan output)
* Plan (approved steps)
* Run bundle (folder layout for each run)
* Receipt (human + machine)
* Message intent (feedback-a-tron routing + redaction)
