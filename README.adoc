AmbientOps is a cross-platform ecosystem of system tools designed for **everyday users** (including “know-nothing” and “drowning” users) who need trustworthy help without fearware, nagware, or scammy “optimizers”.

It is organised around a simple mental model: **a hospital**.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Project status:* *Bootstrap / specification in progress*

This repo is the *front door* (docs, naming, ecosystem manifest, and packaging glue).
Implementation lives in the satellite repos linked below.
====

== The hospital model (how users experience it)

AmbientOps presents system tooling as four “departments”:

* **Ward** — System Weather + gentle, ambient guidance (the daily home)
* **Emergency Room** — panic-safe intake (incident bundle + safety posture + handoff)
* **Operating Room** — planned procedures (Scan → Plan → Apply → Undo → Receipt)
* **Records** — receipts, undo tokens, and shareable help bundles

See `docs/HOSPITAL_MODEL.adoc` for the full model.

== Repositories in the ecosystem

The umbrella repo coordinates, but does not replace, these satellites:

* **Ward UI (tray / ambient):** `hyperpolymath/ops-glance` (name TBD; “Ward” UX)
* **Emergency Room:** `hyperpolymath/emergency-button`
* **Operating Room (procedures engine):** `hyperpolymath/operating-room`
* **Observability dashboard (Julia):** `hyperpolymath/juliadashboard` (name TBD)
* **Personal Sysadmin (clinician workflows):** `hyperpolymath/personal-sysadmin`
* **Hybrid Automation Router (policy-gated execution):** `hyperpolymath/hybrid-automation-router`
* **feedback-a-tron (referrals/discharge notes):** `hyperpolymath/feedback-a-tron`
* **(Recommended) Contracts:** `hyperpolymath/system-tools-contracts`

This repo keeps an ecosystem manifest in `ecosystem/` to make tooling + packaging reproducible.

== Installation philosophy

AmbientOps aims to avoid “install everything” by default.

* **Minimal**: Ward only (System Weather + calm guidance)
* **Typical**: Ward + Emergency Room + Operating Room (safe pack for your OS)
* **Full**: Typical + technician packs + optional adapters

The system should prompt for additional packs only when needed, and always explain why.

== Safety and trust principles

* No fearware claims (“304 errors fixed!”)
* Evidence first: show measurements, not hype
* Scan is non-mutating by default
* Apply requires explicit approval
* Undo and receipts are first-class
* Privacy controls are visible and simple (local-only by default)

== Repository layout

* `docs/` — umbrella documentation and UX model
* `ecosystem/` — machine-readable manifest + compatibility matrix
* `installers/` — packaging glue per OS
* `branding/` — icons/themes previews and brand assets
