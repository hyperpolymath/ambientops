Development roadmap for AmbientOps (umbrella + UX model + packaging glue).

== Phase 0 — Bootstrap (now)

Deliverables:

* AmbientOps umbrella repo established (docs + manifest layout)
* Hospital model documented (`docs/HOSPITAL_MODEL.adoc`)
* Ecosystem manifest created (`ecosystem/repos.json` + `ecosystem/repos.adoc`)
* Baseline trust principles written (anti-fearware copy policy, privacy defaults)

== Phase 1 — Contracts and seams

Goal: stable seams between Ward / ER / OR / Records.

Deliverables:

* `system-tools-contracts` repo (recommended) including:
  - System Weather payload schema
  - Evidence envelope + run-bundle layout
  - Receipt schema (human + machine)
  - Deep-link / intent format for cross-tool navigation
* Versioning rules for contracts (semver + compatibility notes)
* Example bundles checked into `examples/`

== Phase 2 — Ward MVP (daily home)

Goal: ship the “not in your face” experience that prevents panic.

Deliverables:

* Ward tray/menu app (profiles + notification budget + “one next step”)
* HAT roles (coordinator + information + risk + optimisation/positive)
* Theme packs:
  - Professional (default)
  - Kid-friendly (optional)
* Local-only mode fully supported
* Integrations:
  - consume System Weather payload
  - deep-link to Emergency Room and Operating Room plans

== Phase 3 — Emergency Room MVP (panic-safe intake)

Goal: one-click safe capture + handoff.

Deliverables:

* Incident bundle creation (cross-platform best-effort)
* Safety posture toggles (non-destructive, reversible where possible)
* Handoff flows:
  - to Personal Sysadmin crisis workflows
  - to Operating Room scan/plan
* “Share bundle” intent to feedback-a-tron

== Phase 4 — Operating Room MVP (planned procedures)

Goal: “do real work” safely, with receipts and undo.

Deliverables:

* Scan → Plan → Apply → Undo → Receipt end-to-end
* At least one “Typical” safe pack for one OS shipped as v0.1
* UI integration from Ward/ER into procedures
* Basic packaging and distribution (portable + installer where appropriate)

== Phase 5 — Ecosystem polish

Deliverables:

* Cross-platform packaging (“Minimal / Typical / Full”)
* Optional technician packs (expert-gated)
* Optional adapters (external tool integration with clear provenance)
* Documentation site + onboarding flows
* Community contribution lanes (themes/packs/adapters) with strong boundaries
