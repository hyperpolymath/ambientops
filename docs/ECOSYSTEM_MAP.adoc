= AmbientOps Ecosystem Map
:toc: left

This document provides a top-level map of AmbientOps satellites, their roles,
and which responsibilities belong where.

== Core Principle

*AmbientOps is the front door.* It maintains system overview and orchestration
contracts, while satellites implement specialized behavior.

== Satellites and Ownership

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
|Satellite |Primary Role |Owns

|DNFinition + TotalUpdate
|Universal updates + reversibility
|Package surfaces, placement decisions, update audit trails

|Total Recall
|Recovery + investigation
|Rollback workflows, incident analysis, recovery playbooks

|Feedback-a-tron
|Privacy-gated feedback
|Outbox approval, redaction, submission routing

|System Observatory
|Observability + recommendations
|Metrics store, anomaly detection, forecasts (no mutation)

|Personal Sysadmin
|Clinician workflows
|Guided advice, user-facing recommendations
|===

== Data Flow (High Level)

* Updates flow into audit trails (DNFinition/TotalUpdate)
* Observability consumes run bundles and audits (System Observatory)
* Recovery actions reference audits and snapshots (Total Recall)
* Privacy gate mediates all external sharing (Feedback-a-tron)

== Where to Start Work

* *AmbientOps*: central map + policy language
* *System Observatory*: architecture overview and metrics schema
* *Satellites*: implement per-domain capabilities
