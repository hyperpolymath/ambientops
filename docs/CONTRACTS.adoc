This document defines cross-repo data contracts and encoding choices.

== Canonical Encoding

* *Primary*: JSON for single objects
* *Streaming/Logs*: NDJSON (one JSON object per line)
* *Schema*: JSON Schema (draft-07)

JSON-LD is not used as the primary contract at this time.

== Telemetry Channel

* Human-reviewable events remain JSON/NDJSON
* System Observatory may accept Bebop for high-volume telemetry

== Bebop Bridge (Optional)

If used, Bebop is an *internal observability channel* only. A converter
translates JSON events into Bebop records for ingestion, while retaining JSON
as the source of truth.

Converter requirements:

* Input: JSON/NDJSON events conforming to schemas
* Output: Bebop-encoded frames per event type
* Backpressure-safe and loss-aware (retry/queue)

== Contract Stability Rules

* Additive changes only (new fields)
* Never remove or rename fields without a version bump
* All events must include `event_type`, `timestamp`, and `payload`
